## Relationship to Original

This is a complete rewrite and enhancement of the [original Build-A-Chord project](https://github.com/aaronliftig/Build-A-Chord), which was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The original focused on chord visualization and was based on a 2018 Excel project. Build-A-Chord-2 expands on that foundation with:

- Interactive chord building capabilities
- Real-time audio synthesis
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Modern React-based architecture
- Advanced music theory features

## Repository Note

This repository contains only the static build output optimized for GitHub Pages deployment. The source code and development environment are maintained separately for a streamlined deployment process.
